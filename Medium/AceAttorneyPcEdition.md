Ace Attorney: PC Edition
========================
Started: No

A complete port of the DS game to the PC with a much more modifiable interface.

Everything would be editable including the art,sound,cases and anything else.

The engine would support 3D environments and 2D ones, but the ported stuff would be primarily 2D.
